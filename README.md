# Turret Shooting Survival Game

#### Simple Description

Shoot all the zombies! (They might stop spawning)

This is a shooting game with a non-moving turret character.

Just prevent the zombies to come near you. You'll lose your life point.

#### Description

The zombies are getting hungry, and they even want to eat the brain inside of the turret (seriously? wt*?). This turret have a great brain, because he is an artificial intelligence (Supposed to be, but he's being controlled by you).

It will take 3 zombies for them to annihilate Turry's enormous brain.

But unfortunately, because he is a turret, he can't move at all. But at least, he can rotate and blast a fire (Oh that might burn the zombies).

The number of zombies are increasing when they spawn, though, there is a maximum value of spawn. Their spawn location is random, so beware of surprise attack! He might spawn just behind you.

#### Controls

- Press  'left' key to turn anti-clockwise
- Press 'right' key to turn clockwise
- Press 'space' key to fire

All of the assets here are made by me, and I used either "CSS art" or "CSS 'box-shadow' art" to produce all of them.

I used ReactJS to do the logic/algorithm of the game.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
